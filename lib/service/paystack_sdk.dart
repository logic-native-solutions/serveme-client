/// PaystackSdkService (Stub for build compatibility)
/// -------------------------------------------------
/// This stub avoids importing the flutter_paystack plugin, which currently
/// fails to compile against the project's Flutter SDK due to deprecated
/// TextTheme getters removed in Material 3 (e.g., headline1/headline6).
///
/// Behavior
/// - initOnce caches the provided public key and becomes a no-op.
/// - checkoutWithAccessCode returns false so callers can fall back to the
///   browser-based zero-amount card link flow.
///
/// Once a Material 3â€“compatible Paystack SDK (or a patched fork) is available,
/// replace this file with the real implementation and re-add the dependency in
/// pubspec.yaml.
