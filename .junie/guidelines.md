# Project Guidelines

The App that I'm building is called ServeMe.

Brief of the app

ServeMe connects clients (homeowners/tenants) with vetted service providers (e.g., cleaners, electricians, plumbers, nannies).
The MVP focuses on a reliable, compliant, and mobileâ€‘first booking experience with identity verification, simple discovery, frictionless booking, and basic messaging.




I have already created a client UI which is the user who will be requesting for services 

the client :
- messaging 
- booking
- viewing services
- editing profile 
- viewing profile 

which these templates are already implemented 

whats common :
- messaging 
- editing profile
- viewing profile


For provider only
- dashboard will be different from the client 
- Jobs


right now we are implementing these provider templates 
I will upload picture of the design that you will follow 
now the pictures will just guide you on what I want but the themes and fonts and colors you will follow 
what is already being used on the templates that are available 

when you are implementing this I want you to keep track of what you are doing and write meaningful comments
